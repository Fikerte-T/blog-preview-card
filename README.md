## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to position elements using Grid.

### Continued development

I plan to learn  Tailwind CSS and/or styled components and use them in my future projects. I want to also focus on SASS and be comfortable to use it because its crucial for efficent CSS code.
